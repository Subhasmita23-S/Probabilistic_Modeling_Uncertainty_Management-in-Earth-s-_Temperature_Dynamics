## Probabilistic_Modeling_Uncertainty_Management-in-Earth-s-_Temperature_Dynamics
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting global temperature trends using historical climate data. The aim is to understand the patterns and seasonality in temperature changes and develop predictive models to forecast future global temperature anomalies. This includes time series decomposition, imputation of missing values, and model building using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Libraries Used
### Data Handling
- KNNImuter to handle missing values
- MinMaxScaler for scaling features before LSTM modeling.

### Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA, SARIMAX for statistical time series modeling.
- auto_arima for automatically identifying optimal ARIMA parameters.
